## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Before using this boilerplate, you need to check if you have `Node.js` and `NPM` installed on your computer.

To check if you have `Node.js` installed, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
node -v
```

If you get an answer like this, it means that `Node.js` is installed and you may go to the [next section](#scaffolding-your-app).

```sh
v18.16.0
```

To confirm that you have `NPM` installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```sh
npm -v
```

If you get an answer like this, it means that `Node.js` is installed and you may go to the [next section](#scaffolding-your-app).

```sh
9.5.1
```

If `Node.js` or `NPM` is not installed you can install them on [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/) or use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Don't forget to update `NPM` after installing `Node.js`:

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Scaffolding your app

Install [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

```sh
npm install -g degit
```

Scaffold your project into a new folder

```sh
degit https://github.com/som3aware/blaze my-app-folder
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Theming

The colors follow the react native paper `MD2Colors` and react navigation `Theme.colors` interfaces. To add your app colors, open [/themes/index.ts](./src/theme/index.ts) and change the values of the colors.

#### MD2Colors

- `primary` - primary color for your app, usually your brand color.
- `accent` - secondary color for your app which complements the primary color.
- `background` - background color for pages, such as lists.
- `surface` - background color for elements containing content, such as cards.
- `text` - text color for content.
- `disabled` - color for disabled elements.
- `placeholder` - color for placeholder text, such as input placeholder.
- `backdrop` - color for backdrops of various components such as modals.
- `onSurface` - background color for snackbars
- `notification` - background color for badges

#### Theme.colors

- `primary` - primary color of the app used to tint various elements. Usually you'll want to use your brand color for this.
- `background`: color of various backgrounds, such as background color for the screens.
- `card`: background color of card-like elements, such as headers, tab bars etc.
- `text`: text color of various elements.
- `border`: color of borders, e.g. header border, tab bar border etc.
- `notification`: color of Tab Navigator badge.

### Screens

- Define your screens under [/screens](./src/screens/).
- Follow the screen structure in [One.tsx](./src/screens/One.tsx).
- Export your screen from [/screens/index.ts](./src/screens/index.ts).

### Navigation

Add your application stack navigation screens in [AppStackNavigator.tsx](./src/navigation/AppStackNavigator.tsx)
